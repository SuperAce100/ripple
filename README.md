# Ripple Search

![Ripple Search](./assets/ripple_wide.png)

Ripple is an adaptive search engine that doesn’t send you links—it instantly assembles the interface you need to answer your question.

## Why Ripple?

Traditional search returns a page of hyperlinks and leaves the heavy lifting to you. Ripple streams back an interactive UI generated on-the-fly so you can explore results, visualise data, and take action in one place.

### Generative UI

- Dynamic component assembly powered by large language models
- Interfaces change with the intent of each query
- No two sessions look the same—Ripple adapts to your needs in real time

### Cerebras-powered inference

All model inference runs on Cerebras Wafer-Scale hardware, giving Ripple the headroom to generate full UIs in milliseconds.

## Example use cases

- Ask for **UCL final score in 2020** and get a scoreboard
- Ask to compare AWS, GCP, and Azure and get a comparison table

## Vision

We believe that in the near future, every query deserves its own purpose-built application. Ripple is the first step toward that future.

## Getting started for contributors
